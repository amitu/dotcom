Github: [ellie/atuin](https://github.com/ellie/atuin)

> - rebind ctrl-r and up (configurable) to a full screen history search UI
> - store shell history in a sqlite database
> - backup and sync encrypted shell history
> - the same history across terminals, across sessions, and across machines
> - log exit code, cwd, hostname, session, command duration, etc
> - calculate statistics such as "most used command"
> - switch filter modes via ctrl-r; search history just from the current
    session, directory, or globally
