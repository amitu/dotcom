-- my-ds.page: Autolink

Github has a feature called [autolink](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/managing-repository-settings/configuring-autolinks-to-reference-external-resources),
which can be used to link text in PR/issue comments, commit messages etc to an
external resource, eg to a Jira ticker, if the pattern matches. Eg you can
configure things such that if someone uses the text `JIRA123`, it creates an
auto link to `https://jira.com/ticket/123`.
