-- ds.page: Workspace Dependencies In Rust

If you are maintaining multiple crates as part of single workspace, and you want
to use **same version for dependencies across all crates in your workspace**,
it is possible to specify dependency version the workspace's toml file:

-- ds.code: in workspace's `Cargo.toml`
lang: toml

[workspace]
members = [
    "crate1"
]

[workspace.dependencies]
log = "0.3.1"
log2 = { version = "2.0.0", package = "log" }
serde = { git = 'https://github.com/serde-rs/serde' }
wasm-bindgen-cli = { path = "crates/cli" }

-- ds.code: in a workspace member's `Cargo.toml`
lang: toml

[dependencies]
log = { workspace = true }

-- ds.markdown:

Since the member is saying `workspace=true` as the version for the `log` create,
the version of log crate in the member will be inherited from the workspace.
